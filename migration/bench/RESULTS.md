# P5-06b: instance fromJSON and validate() (2026-09-26)

Task P5-06b (accordproject/concerto-rust#227, under the migration plan
accordproject/concerto-rust#29) worked on the two instance operations only:
`Serializer.fromJSON` and `Resource.validate()` through the TS public API
in rust mode, and the crate's instance paths behind them (the populator,
the factory, `validate_instance`). It builds on P5-06 (the section below).
Its profile breakdown is on the issue.

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor @ 2.10GHz, 4 cores, 15 GiB, Linux (same kind as P5-06) |
| Toolchain | Node v22.22.2, rustc 1.94.1, wasm-bindgen 0.2.128, binaryen 132 |
| Before | `concerto` `38c5926dc`, `concerto-rust` `c9ea114`: the integration heads with P5-06 (concerto#1371, concerto-rust#225) merged in, built as-is |
| After | the P5-06b commits on top (`concerto` `3a4b0d892`, `concerto-rust` `009c298`) |
| TS-API runs | `results/*-P5-06b-{before,after}-{ts,rust-engine}.json`: two runs of each, `run-ts.mjs` defaults (5 warm-up + 30 samples), before and after back to back |
| Crate runs | `concerto-rust`'s `benches/results/*-rust-P5-06b-{before,after}.json` (criterion defaults) |

## Through the TS public API (the exit condition's comparison)

Medians, µs per instance (500 instances). Ratios use the mean of the two
runs, each against the TS runs made next to it.

| Metric | TS before, run 1 / 2 | Rust engine before, run 1 / 2 | TS after, run 1 / 2 | Rust engine after, run 1 / 2 | before / TS | **after / TS** | speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fromJSON | 7.9 / 8.0 | 45.2 / 44.3 | 8.5 / 7.8 | 19.5 / 19.2 | 5.6× | **2.4×** | 2.3× |
| resource.validate() | 1.9 / 2.0 | 17.5 / 17.8 | 2.3 / 2.1 | 6.5 / 6.4 | 9.1× | **2.9×** | 2.7× |

**The exit condition (≤ 1.0× the TS reference) is not met.** The best
ratios reached are 2.4× for fromJSON and 2.9× for resource.validate(). (P5-06
reported 5.7× and 6.8× against a TS validate() median of 2.75 µs; on this
run's TS medians, the same P5-06 code is 5.6× and 9.1×.)

## The Rust crate directly

Criterion (`cargo bench`), µs per instance or per model:

| Benchmark | Before | After | Speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validate_instance` (500) | 2.43 | 0.68 | 3.6× |
| load / validate / `ModelFile::from_json`, every model set | - | - | 0.97× to 1.03× (unchanged, noise) |

`Serializer::from_json` has no criterion bench; the profiling harness
(the same 500 instances, parsed from JSON text as the binding does, then
`Serializer::from_json` with `validate: true`, native, release build) gives
22.2 µs and 332 allocations per instance before, 8.4 µs and 105 after.
`validate_instance` with its JSON parse drops from 57 allocations to 19.

## What changed

All performance-only. Results and errors are unchanged:
- The oracle replays 16,242 fixtures (the canonical corpus plus the
  supplement, CTO cache checked) with 0 regressions, and `baseline.tsv` is
  unchanged after `ORACLE_UPDATE_BASELINE=1`.
- The concerto-core suite passes 1,299 of 1,300 in both modes; the one
  failure is `ModelLoader #loadModelFromUrl` (HTTP 403 in this sandbox), as
  on the base.
- A differential run (a scratch script, not committed) gives the same
  results, errors and resulting own properties in ts and rust mode. It
  covers fromJSON, with and without validation, over 36 documents, and
  validate() over 30 resources: valid and invalid ones, a stale
  `$identifier`, non-finite numbers, nested resources, relationship
  options, `__proto__` keys and lone surrogates.

The changes, by where the time was going:
- **The crate's instance paths** (`concerto-core`).
  - A per-class table (`ClassInfo`: the inherited identifying field, every
    property with its declaring type, each property's resolved type,
    `assignFieldDefaults`' values and the identifier's regex validator),
    cached in the `ModelManager` by declaration handle and dropped with the
    super-chain cache on every change to the registered files. Only
    successful answers are kept; anything else takes the uncached path,
    which raises the same errors as before. The validator, the populator,
    the factory and `resource::validate` read it, instead of cloning every
    inherited property and walking the super chain again per instance.
  - Fewer allocations: property values read in place, the populator's
    `parameters.path` kept unformatted until a message needs it, the
    serializer options read in place, `Instance::set` without a new key
    string for a key it already has, pre-sized maps.
- **The boundary** (`concerto-wasm`, additive bindings, and the engine
  shim).
  - `serializerFromJsonLean`: fromJSON's one call now answers with a lean
    recipe: the resource's own properties in order, each either an index
    into the input object's values (when the populated value is exactly
    that input value) or its wire encoding. `materializeLean` builds the
    same `Resource`/`ValidatedResource` as `materializeTyped` from it.
  - A plain input object crosses as its own `JSON.stringify` text: the
    encoder keeps plain JSON as it is and checks for lone surrogates once,
    on the text.
  - The wire text is read straight into the instance values
    (`parse_wire`), and the serializer options are decoded once per
    distinct text.
  - `ValidatedResource.validate()` makes one engine call instead of a TS
    visitor walk with one call per class lookup and per field:
    `resourceValidateSimple` for a resource of plain fields (sent already
    in the validator's shape), `resourceValidateFast` otherwise. It is only
    taken when the resource's `$validator` is a plain `ResourceValidator`
    and its model manager resolves its type to the declaration it holds.
    It answers a boolean: an invalid resource, or one where the walk's
    `$identifier` write would change anything, goes through the visitor
    path, which raises and writes exactly as before.

## Why parity is out of reach here

The profile after this change (rust mode, per instance):
- **resource.validate(), 6.5 µs** against 2.1 µs for the whole TS
  validate(). Encoding the resource in JS (0.9 µs), copying the UTF-8 text
  into WASM (0.65 µs) and parsing it into a `serde_json::Value` (1.2 µs)
  already cost more than the TS reference before any validation runs; the
  validation itself is 1.35 µs in WASM (0.68 µs natively). D7 keeps
  instances in TS, so every validate() has to send the instance across.
- **fromJSON, 19.4 µs** against 8.1 µs. The part that stays in TS whatever
  the engine does (the `ValidatedResource` constructor, 1.5 µs, of which
  0.5 µs is its `getIdentifierFieldName()` view crossing, and `getType`,
  0.65 µs) and the marshalling (about 3 µs) come to about 5 µs; the crate's
  populate and validate are about 7 µs in WASM, still allocation-bound
  (105 allocations per instance natively, dlmalloc and SipHash-keyed maps
  in WASM).

Levers not taken: validating the populated instance without first copying
it into the validator's `serde_json::Value` shape (a rewrite of the
validator's 3,900 lines); a different allocator or hasher in the WASM
build; keeping instances resident in WASM (against D7); and memoising
validate() results for resources that did not change, which would only pay
off when a benchmark validates the same resources again and again.

# P5-06: after the performance pass (2026-09-26)

Task P5-06 (accordproject/concerto-rust#220, under the migration plan
accordproject/concerto-rust#29) re-ran the P5-04 suite unchanged: the same
`run-ts.mjs` script and fixtures, and the same `cargo bench`, on the same
kind of machine. Each figure is run on this machine back to back, before
and after the change. The profile breakdown the changes are based on is on
the issue.

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor @ 2.10GHz, 4 cores, 15 GiB, Linux |
| Toolchain | Node v22.22.2, rustc 1.94.1, wasm-bindgen 0.2.128, binaryen 132 |
| Before | `concerto` `77189c436`, `concerto-rust` `2fdd791` (both `origin/claude/tender-pascal-ocwf9q`), built as-is |
| After | the P5-06 commits on top of those heads (`concerto-rust` `5e3f330`) |
| TS-API runs | `results/*-P5-06-{before,after}-{ts,rust-engine}.json`: two runs of each, `run-ts.mjs` defaults (5 warm-up + 30 samples) |
| Crate runs | `concerto-rust`'s `benches/results/*-rust-P5-06-{before,after}.json` (criterion defaults) |

## Through the TS public API (the exit condition's comparison)

Medians, µs per model or per instance. `load+validate` is `run-ts.mjs`'s
`validate` metric, which times a fresh load and `validateModelFiles()`
together. "TS" is the TS reference. Its code path is unchanged by P5-06,
and its "after" runs are shown; the "before" runs agree within noise. The
ratios use the mean of the two runs.

| Model set | Metric | TS, run 1 / 2 | Rust engine before, run 1 / 2 | Rust engine after, run 1 / 2 | before / TS | **after / TS** | speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| concerto-core-test-data | load | 33.0 / 53.8 | 1356.3 / 1486.4 | 642.9 / 512.9 | 40.4× | **13.3×** | 2.5× |
| concerto-core-test-data | load+validate | 66.6 / 66.7 | 2048.4 / 2080.3 | 1125.0 / 1140.1 | 27.8× | **17.0×** | 1.8× |
| concerto-core-test-data | validateAst | 638.1 / 671.8 | 4097.7 / 4350.1 | 1116.1 / 1099.8 | 6.5× | **1.7×** | 3.8× |
| conformance | load | 15.9 / 16.0 | 677.7 / 670.5 | 413.0 / 374.5 | 41.9× | **24.6×** | 1.7× |
| conformance | load+validate | 27.7 / 24.0 | 883.1 / 879.2 | 509.8 / 575.9 | 34.4× | **21.0×** | 1.6× |
| conformance | validateAst | 244.8 / 254.8 | 3009.0 / 2923.6 | 616.6 / 632.3 | 11.7× | **2.5×** | 4.8× |
| synthetic-large | load | 697.1 / 676.0 | 70268.3 / 77344.0 | 27890.4 / 27526.6 | 105.6× | **40.4×** | 2.7× |
| synthetic-large | load+validate | 2263.5 / 2167.2 | 94772.7 / 98133.0 | 37687.0 / 38850.8 | 42.4× | **17.3×** | 2.5× |
| synthetic-large | validateAst | SKIPPED | SKIPPED | SKIPPED | - | - | - |
| (synthetic, 500) | fromJSON | 8.7 / 8.1 | 129.4 / 133.7 | 47.2 / 49.3 | 16.5× | **5.7×** | 2.7× |
| (synthetic, 500) | resource.validate() | 3.5 / 2.0 | 71.5 / 64.8 | 18.2 / 19.6 | 32.8× | **6.8×** | 3.6× |

The Rust engine through the TS API is now 1.6× to 4.8× faster than before
P5-06. It is still slower than the TS reference on every operation: 1.7×
to 2.5× on validateAst, 5.7× to 6.8× on instance fromJSON/validate, and
13× to 40× on model load and validate. **The exit condition (≤ 1.0× on all
of these) is not met.** The best achieved ratios are in the "after / TS"
column.
`synthetic-large` validateAst is still rejected by both engines, as in
P5-04: its `DateTimeProperty` default value fails `validateAst`'s strict
check.

JS->WASM calls per operation, counted with a wrapper around the engine
module. The counts are for a first load, before any memo is warm.

| Operation | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `new ModelManager()` | 558 | 266 |
| load, concerto-core-test-data (per model) | 103.7 | 62.2 |
| load, conformance (per model) | 20.6 | 15.4 |
| load, synthetic-large (one model) | 5,271 | 1,179 |
| validateModelFiles / validateAst (per model) | 1.1 / 1.1 | 1.1 / 1.1 |

## The Rust crate directly (criterion)

The same benches as Table A below: medians in µs per model or per
instance. These figures are the crate's own speed-up; they do not measure
the boundary.

| Benchmark | Before | After | Speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| load, concerto-core-test-data | 96.4 | 50.6 | 1.90× |
| validate, concerto-core-test-data | 67.8 | 57.0 | 1.19× |
| load, conformance | 37.7 | 21.8 | 1.73× |
| validate, conformance | 35.7 | 24.4 | 1.46× |
| load, synthetic-large | 5567.7 | 2789.7 | 2.00× |
| validate, synthetic-large | 3667.6 | 3317.2 | 1.11× |
| `ModelFile::from_json`, concerto-core-test-data | 101.0 | 47.7 | 2.12× |
| `ModelFile::from_json`, conformance | 33.5 | 18.6 | 1.80× |
| `ModelFile::from_json`, synthetic-large | 6538.3 | 2653.3 | 2.46× |
| `validate_instance` (500) | 4.2 | 2.3 | 1.85× |

## What changed

All of these are performance-only. Results and errors are unchanged:
- The oracle replays 16,242 fixtures with 0 regressions, and `baseline.tsv`
  is unchanged after `ORACLE_UPDATE_BASELINE=1`.
- The concerto-core suite passes 1,299 of 1,300 tests in both modes. The
  one failure is `ModelLoader #loadModelFromUrl`, which needs the network
  and gets HTTP 403 in this sandbox; it fails the same way on the unchanged
  base.
- The API snapshot is byte-identical.

The changes, by where the time was going:
- **Module resolution.** `loadEngine` is memoised per specifier, and the
  per-element `require`s in the views are cached.
- **Crossings.**
  - `modelFilePropertySnapshots` gives each `ModelFile` view every
    property's `propertyProcess`/`fieldProcess` snapshot in one call. The
    per-property bindings stay as the fallback, so errors come from the
    same call as before.
  - The pure string `ModelUtil` delegations are memoised by argument.
  - `ModelManagerHandle.epoch()` lets the views cache `getNamespaces()` and
    `modelFileId()` between mutations.
- **The crate.** Changes to `concerto-core` itself:
  - Declaration, property and scalar nodes are deserialised from borrowed
    JSON instead of clones.
  - `is_valid_identifier` has an ASCII fast path.
  - The system and metamodel model files are cached.
  - Compiled `StringValidator` regexes are cached.
  - Super-type chains are memoised, and property lookup no longer clones
    every inherited property.
- **The WASM build** is optimised for speed (`opt-level = 3`,
  `wasm-opt -O3`). The module is 2.56 MB, inside the 4 MiB budget.

## Why load/validate cannot reach parity yet

In rust mode, `concerto-core` builds the full TS view graph of every model
file, as the TS reference does. It then also sends the whole AST across the
boundary (`JSON.stringify`, then a serde parse and `ModelFile::from_json`
in WASM):
- once for the property snapshots;
- once for the `rustHandle` mirror (P4-08);
- once more for `ModelFile.validate()`'s `modelFileValidateDetached`.

Each of those whole-AST round trips alone costs about as much as the TS
reference's entire load of the same model set. Through the public API,
load and validate therefore stay slower than TS for as long as both the TS
graph and the Rust mirror exist.

In the profile after this change:
- The two load-time round trips are about 45% of rust-mode load for
  `synthetic-large`.
- The remaining per-declaration crossings are about 10%:
  `classDeclarationProcess`, `decoratorProcess`, and the synthetic
  `$identifier`/`$timestamp` fields' `propertyProcess`.
- `new ModelManager()` building the system models' views is about 10%.

Closing that gap means not materialising the TS graph in rust mode (the
P5-02 direction), or views that read lazily from the Rust arena instead of
being built eagerly. That is beyond a performance-only change.

# Baseline: TS vs Rust (task P5-04)

Committed baseline for accordproject/concerto-rust#75 (task P5-04, under
the migration plan accordproject/concerto-rust#29). Extends the P5-04a
baseline (accordproject/concerto-rust#92, kept below as an appendix) with:

- workload 3 (instance validation) on the Rust side, now that the instance
  validator has landed (task P3-01, `concerto_core::instance::validate`);
- a second Rust comparison point, run through concerto-core's own public
  API rather than the crate directly - see "Two different Rust numbers"
  below, which is the main thing this task adds.

Per the coordinator's release-early note on the issue: this was recorded
before task P5-01's full gate finished, at the exact heads named there -
`concerto` `fe5358c68` and `concerto-rust` `ba060b3` (see "Machine and
toolchain"). It is not re-run after the gate; the maintainer re-runs it
manually later if wanted.

## Two different Rust numbers

There are two legitimately different ways to ask "how fast is Rust", and
this baseline reports both rather than picking one:

1. **The Rust crate directly** (`concerto-rust`'s `benches/`, criterion,
   calling `concerto-core`'s Rust API with no TS or WASM involved at all).
   This is what P5-04a measured, and what "Table A" below updates.
2. **The Rust engine through concerto-core's TS public API**
   (`CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs`, the same
   script, same fixtures, same process as the plain TS run, but every
   `ModelManager`/`Resource` call now round-trips through
   `@accordproject/concerto-engine`, the WASM build of `concerto-wasm`).
   This is what an application actually gets today when it turns the
   engine flag on, and it is "Table B" below - new for this task, and the
   comparison the issue's exit condition and the coordinator's note both
   ask for ("the same set of models for both the finished Rust-backed
   concerto-core and the original TS reference").

These tell different stories - see Table B's summary - and neither one
alone is "the" Rust number.

Every JSON file carries standard deviation and coefficient of variation
(CV) per entry; the tables below report median and CV per workload, per
the issue ("report medians and variance per workload in a markdown
table").

## Table A: the Rust crate directly vs TS (workloads 1 and 2)

Updates the P5-04a table (below) on the current heads. All figures are
medians, per model (µs/op). "Rust /TS" is Rust's time divided by TS's
(< 1 means Rust is faster).

| Model set | n | Phase | TS (µs) | TS CV | Rust crate (µs) | Rust CV | Rust /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| concerto-core-test-data | 35 | load | 32.3 | 28.0% | 93.0 | 6.2% | 2.88× (slower) |
| concerto-core-test-data | 35 | validate | 66.9 | 17.1% | 66.0 | 10.3% | 0.99× (~even) |
| conformance | 41 | load | 16.2 | 27.2% | 37.3 | 6.6% | 2.30× (slower) |
| conformance | 41 | validate | 24.6 | 27.0% | 34.3 | 12.9% | 1.39× (slower) |
| synthetic-large | 1 (300 decls) | load | 682.7 | 33.5% | 5801.0 | 9.1% | 8.50× (slower)¹ |
| synthetic-large | 1 (300 decls) | validate | 2255.2 | 15.6% | 3496.9 | 5.1% | 1.55× (slower) |

`validate` no longer needs to be skipped on any set - the P5-04a gap
("explicit-over-explicit identity and inherited identifier lookup", plan
§1.2) that skipped `concerto-core-test-data`/`synthetic-large` `validate`
in that baseline has since closed.

¹ `load` (`add_model`/`from_json`, purely structural, no semantic
validation) is the one phase where the Rust crate is consistently slower
than TS across all three sets, most severely on the single large model -
this matches P5-04a's finding and is carried forward unchanged; it was
not this task's scope to investigate.

### Workload 2: validating the metamodel AST

TS's `validateAst` vs `concerto-core`'s `ModelFile::from_json` (the same
structural check `add_model`'s `load` above performs, isolated here on
its own). `concerto-validate-rs`'s half of this workload (the
`validate-rs` feature) is unchanged from P5-04a and not re-run here - see
`concerto-rust`'s `benches/README.md`.

| Model set | n (TS / core) | TS validateAst (µs) | TS CV | core from_json (µs) | core CV | core /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| concerto-core-test-data | 34 / 35 | 684.5 | 13.9% | 90.7 | 9.0% | **0.133× (7.5× faster)** |
| conformance | 41 / 41 | 244.7 | 4.7% | 33.3 | 16.7%² | **0.136× (7.4× faster)** |
| synthetic-large | 0 / 1 | SKIPPED³ | - | 6202.1 | 14.8% | - |

² Taken from the same-model figure in the `validate_metamodel_conformance`
criterion group (the concerto-core-test-data/conformance sets are
identical AST fixtures for both `add_model`'s `load` and this workload).
³ TS's `validateAst` still rejects every model in `synthetic-large` (a
`DateTimeProperty` with a `defaultValue` - a `validateAst`-specific edge
case, not present in the normal load path); unchanged from P5-04a.

## Table B: the same public API, TS vs the Rust engine (WASM)

**New for this task.** Both rows of each pair are the *same* `run-ts.mjs`
script, same fixtures, same process, only `CONCERTO_ENGINE` differs -
`ts` (the reference implementation) vs `rust` (concerto-core delegating
to `@accordproject/concerto-engine`, the `concerto-wasm` build of the
finished Rust-backed concerto-core, task P4-01/P4-02). This is the "for
the finished Rust-backed concerto-core and the original TS reference, on
the same set of models" comparison the issue and the coordinator's note
ask for, and it is a very different result from Table A:

| Workload | Model set | n | TS (µs) | Rust engine (µs) | Rust engine /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| load_validate | concerto-core-test-data | 35 | load: 32.3 | load: 1292.9 | **40.0× (slower)** |
| load_validate | concerto-core-test-data | 35 | validate: 66.9 | validate: 2136.6 | **31.9× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | concerto-core-test-data | 34 | 684.5 | 4431.4 | **6.5× (slower)** |
| load_validate | conformance | 41 | load: 16.2 | load: 757.8 | **46.8× (slower)** |
| load_validate | conformance | 41 | validate: 24.6 | validate: 924.4 | **37.6× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | conformance | 41 | 244.7 | 2952.5 | **12.1× (slower)** |
| load_validate | synthetic-large | 1 | load: 682.7 | load: 73461.5 | **107.6× (slower)** |
| load_validate | synthetic-large | 1 | validate: 2255.2 | validate: 99452.6 | **44.1× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | synthetic-large | 1 | SKIPPED³ | SKIPPED³ | - |
| instance_validate | (synthetic) | 500 | fromJSON: 8.8 | fromJSON: 131.2 | **14.9× (slower)** |
| instance_validate | (synthetic) | 500 | validate_only: 2.1 | validate_only: 64.6 | **30.8× (slower)** |

**Through the TS public API, the Rust engine is uniformly slower than the
TS reference today - by 6× to over 100×**, the opposite conclusion from
Table A (where the Rust crate itself is competitive or faster once
`validate`/`from_json` are isolated). The two tables are both correct;
they measure different things:

- Table A calls `concerto-core`'s Rust API directly, in one process, no
  serialisation boundary.
- Table B's `rust` rows go through `concerto-core`'s TS views
  (`src/engine/`), which for every `ModelManager`/`ModelFile` operation
  in these workloads currently: serialises the AST/value to a JSON
  string on the TS side (`JSON.stringify`), crosses into WASM, and
  (for `add_model`/`validateAst`) re-parses it there - `load_validate`'s
  per-model `add_model` and `validate_ast` each do this once *per model*,
  so the 35- and 41-model sets pay that cost 35 and 41 times over, and
  the single 300-declaration `synthetic-large` model pays it once for a
  much larger string. This matches the migration plan's own risk list
  (§7: "WASM boundary cost and browser sync-compile limits") and the
  P4-01 spike's brief - it is the expected shape of an unoptimised
  per-call FFI boundary, not a defect in the underlying Rust logic
  (Table A's `validate`/`from_json` numbers show that logic is already
  fast). No fast-path batching (e.g. handing the whole model set across
  the boundary once) exists yet for these calls; that is future work, not
  something this benchmarking task changes (see "Scope" below).

³ Both engines reject `synthetic-large` in `validate_ast`, for different
surface reasons that both round-trip to the same TS message: TS's own
`validateAst` schema check rejects the `DateTimeProperty` `defaultValue`
in that model (footnote 3 above); under `CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust`, the
call reaches `rustHandle.validateAst` first and is rejected there before
TS's own check would even run. Either way, `n=0/1` for this cell in both
columns.

## Workload 3: instance validation

New this task on the Rust crate side (task P3-01 landed
`concerto_core::instance::validate::validate_instance` after P5-04a
shipped): `concerto-rust`'s `benches/instance_validate.rs` times
`validate_instance` alone, over the *same* 500-instance workload
`run-ts.mjs` generates (`org.accordproject.bench.instance@1.0.0.Item`,
built directly from its `concerto.metamodel@1.0.0` AST on the Rust side,
since there is no CTO parser there - see that bench file's docs).

There is still no `JSONPopulator`/`Resource` port on the Rust side (task
P3-01b), so only `validate_instance` - the counterpart to TS's
`resource.validate()` alone, **not** to `Serializer#fromJSON`'s combined
populate-and-validate figure - is comparable to the Rust crate:

| Metric | n | TS (µs/op) | TS CV | Rust crate (µs/op) | Rust CV | Rust /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Serializer#fromJSON` (populate + validate) | 500 | 8.8 | 25.2% | - (no populator yet) | - | - |
| `Resource#validate()` / `validate_instance` | 500 | 2.1 | 13.2% | 4.4 | 9.2% | 2.1× (slower) |

The Rust engine (WASM)-via-TS figures for both metrics are in Table B
above (14.9× and 30.8× slower than TS respectively) - the same
boundary-cost story as the rest of that table.

## Reproducibility

Each harness was run twice on this machine, back to back:

- **TS** (`run-ts.mjs`, both engines): every workload's median reproduced
  within about 1-20% between the two runs (worst case:
  `concerto-core-test-data`/`load` under `CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust`, 1548.5 µs
  then 1292.9 µs, ~20%; most workloads were within 10%, consistent with
  P5-04a's "10-15%" finding).
- **Rust crate** (`cargo bench --manifest-path benches/Cargo.toml`): a
  full run (committed above) followed by a `--quick` rerun agreed within
  each benchmark's own confidence interval - criterion's own built-in
  comparison reported "No change in performance detected" (p > 0.05) on
  every one of the nine `load_validate`/`validate_metamodel` benchmarks.

Per-sample CV is noisier for the smallest, sub-100µs-per-op workloads in
this shared, sandboxed environment (GC pauses, scheduler jitter) - see
`migration/bench/README.md`'s "Variance" section - but medians hold up
across reruns, which is what the exit condition asks for.

## Scope

Per the coordinator's note on the issue: this task added only new
benchmark files (`concerto-rust`'s `benches/benches/instance_validate.rs`
and this repo's `run-ts.mjs`/`RESULTS.md` extensions) plus building the
already-existing `concerto-wasm` crate unchanged (`sh build.sh`) so
`CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust` could be exercised - no engine, view, or test
changes. `run-ts.mjs`'s existing `validateAst` stub gained a `getName()`
method (the rust-delegating branch of `BaseModelManager#validateAst`
calls it; the TS branch never needed it) so `validate_ast` could run
under both engines - the only change to a P5-04a file.

## Refreshing this table

```sh
# TS reference
cd concerto
CONCERTO_ENGINE=ts node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs --out migration/bench/results/ts-reference.json

# Rust engine via the TS public API - needs `@accordproject/concerto-engine`
# built first: cd ../concerto-rust/concerto-wasm && sh build.sh
# (see packages/concerto-engine/README.md)
CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs --out migration/bench/results/ts-rust-engine.json

# Rust crate directly (add --features validate-rs for the
# concerto-validate-rs half of workload 2)
cd ../concerto-rust
cargo bench --manifest-path benches/Cargo.toml && ./benches/extract-results.sh
```

Re-run after later phases land, as the plan asks (§4, task P5-04), and
update the tables above from the new `results/*.json` files.

## Appendix: the P5-04a baseline (2026-09-24)

Kept verbatim for history; Table A above supersedes its numbers on the
current heads (the `validate` skips it records have since closed).

Committed baseline for accordproject/concerto-rust#92 (task P5-04a).
Recorded from one run of each harness, on the same machine, in the same
session: `run-ts.mjs` with its defaults (5 warm-up + 30 timed samples per
workload) and a full criterion run (criterion's defaults: 3 s warm-up,
100 samples per benchmark - *not* `--quick`).
