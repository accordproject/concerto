# Baseline: TS vs Rust (task P5-04)

Committed baseline for accordproject/concerto-rust#75 (task P5-04, under
the migration plan accordproject/concerto-rust#29). Extends the P5-04a
baseline (accordproject/concerto-rust#92, kept below as an appendix) with:

- workload 3 (instance validation) on the Rust side, now that the instance
  validator has landed (task P3-01, `concerto_core::instance::validate`);
- a second Rust comparison point, run through concerto-core's own public
  API rather than the crate directly - see "Two different Rust numbers"
  below, which is the main thing this task adds.

Per the coordinator's release-early note on the issue: this was recorded
before task P5-01's full gate finished, at the exact heads named there -
`concerto` `fe5358c68` and `concerto-rust` `ba060b3` (see "Machine and
toolchain"). It is not re-run after the gate; the maintainer re-runs it
manually later if wanted.

## Two different Rust numbers

There are two legitimately different ways to ask "how fast is Rust", and
this baseline reports both rather than picking one:

1. **The Rust crate directly** (`concerto-rust`'s `benches/`, criterion,
   calling `concerto-core`'s Rust API with no TS or WASM involved at all).
   This is what P5-04a measured, and what "Table A" below updates.
2. **The Rust engine through concerto-core's TS public API**
   (`CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs`, the same
   script, same fixtures, same process as the plain TS run, but every
   `ModelManager`/`Resource` call now round-trips through
   `@accordproject/concerto-engine`, the WASM build of `concerto-wasm`).
   This is what an application actually gets today when it turns the
   engine flag on, and it is "Table B" below - new for this task, and the
   comparison the issue's exit condition and the coordinator's note both
   ask for ("the same set of models for both the finished Rust-backed
   concerto-core and the original TS reference").

These tell different stories - see Table B's summary - and neither one
alone is "the" Rust number.

Every JSON file carries standard deviation and coefficient of variation
(CV) per entry; the tables below report median and CV per workload, per
the issue ("report medians and variance per workload in a markdown
table").

## Table A: the Rust crate directly vs TS (workloads 1 and 2)

Updates the P5-04a table (below) on the current heads. All figures are
medians, per model (µs/op). "Rust /TS" is Rust's time divided by TS's
(< 1 means Rust is faster).

| Model set | n | Phase | TS (µs) | TS CV | Rust crate (µs) | Rust CV | Rust /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| concerto-core-test-data | 35 | load | 32.3 | 28.0% | 93.0 | 6.2% | 2.88× (slower) |
| concerto-core-test-data | 35 | validate | 66.9 | 17.1% | 66.0 | 10.3% | 0.99× (~even) |
| conformance | 41 | load | 16.2 | 27.2% | 37.3 | 6.6% | 2.30× (slower) |
| conformance | 41 | validate | 24.6 | 27.0% | 34.3 | 12.9% | 1.39× (slower) |
| synthetic-large | 1 (300 decls) | load | 682.7 | 33.5% | 5801.0 | 9.1% | 8.50× (slower)¹ |
| synthetic-large | 1 (300 decls) | validate | 2255.2 | 15.6% | 3496.9 | 5.1% | 1.55× (slower) |

`validate` no longer needs to be skipped on any set - the P5-04a gap
("explicit-over-explicit identity and inherited identifier lookup", plan
§1.2) that skipped `concerto-core-test-data`/`synthetic-large` `validate`
in that baseline has since closed.

¹ `load` (`add_model`/`from_json`, purely structural, no semantic
validation) is the one phase where the Rust crate is consistently slower
than TS across all three sets, most severely on the single large model -
this matches P5-04a's finding and is carried forward unchanged; it was
not this task's scope to investigate.

### Workload 2: validating the metamodel AST

TS's `validateAst` vs `concerto-core`'s `ModelFile::from_json` (the same
structural check `add_model`'s `load` above performs, isolated here on
its own). `concerto-validate-rs`'s half of this workload (the
`validate-rs` feature) is unchanged from P5-04a and not re-run here - see
`concerto-rust`'s `benches/README.md`.

| Model set | n (TS / core) | TS validateAst (µs) | TS CV | core from_json (µs) | core CV | core /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| concerto-core-test-data | 34 / 35 | 684.5 | 13.9% | 90.7 | 9.0% | **0.133× (7.5× faster)** |
| conformance | 41 / 41 | 244.7 | 4.7% | 33.3 | 16.7%² | **0.136× (7.4× faster)** |
| synthetic-large | 0 / 1 | SKIPPED³ | - | 6202.1 | 14.8% | - |

² Taken from the same-model figure in the `validate_metamodel_conformance`
criterion group (the concerto-core-test-data/conformance sets are
identical AST fixtures for both `add_model`'s `load` and this workload).
³ TS's `validateAst` still rejects every model in `synthetic-large` (a
`DateTimeProperty` with a `defaultValue` - a `validateAst`-specific edge
case, not present in the normal load path); unchanged from P5-04a.

## Table B: the same public API, TS vs the Rust engine (WASM)

**New for this task.** Both rows of each pair are the *same* `run-ts.mjs`
script, same fixtures, same process, only `CONCERTO_ENGINE` differs -
`ts` (the reference implementation) vs `rust` (concerto-core delegating
to `@accordproject/concerto-engine`, the `concerto-wasm` build of the
finished Rust-backed concerto-core, task P4-01/P4-02). This is the "for
the finished Rust-backed concerto-core and the original TS reference, on
the same set of models" comparison the issue and the coordinator's note
ask for, and it is a very different result from Table A:

| Workload | Model set | n | TS (µs) | Rust engine (µs) | Rust engine /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| load_validate | concerto-core-test-data | 35 | load: 32.3 | load: 1292.9 | **40.0× (slower)** |
| load_validate | concerto-core-test-data | 35 | validate: 66.9 | validate: 2136.6 | **31.9× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | concerto-core-test-data | 34 | 684.5 | 4431.4 | **6.5× (slower)** |
| load_validate | conformance | 41 | load: 16.2 | load: 757.8 | **46.8× (slower)** |
| load_validate | conformance | 41 | validate: 24.6 | validate: 924.4 | **37.6× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | conformance | 41 | 244.7 | 2952.5 | **12.1× (slower)** |
| load_validate | synthetic-large | 1 | load: 682.7 | load: 73461.5 | **107.6× (slower)** |
| load_validate | synthetic-large | 1 | validate: 2255.2 | validate: 99452.6 | **44.1× (slower)** |
| validate_ast | synthetic-large | 1 | SKIPPED³ | SKIPPED³ | - |
| instance_validate | (synthetic) | 500 | fromJSON: 8.8 | fromJSON: 131.2 | **14.9× (slower)** |
| instance_validate | (synthetic) | 500 | validate_only: 2.1 | validate_only: 64.6 | **30.8× (slower)** |

**Through the TS public API, the Rust engine is uniformly slower than the
TS reference today - by 6× to over 100×**, the opposite conclusion from
Table A (where the Rust crate itself is competitive or faster once
`validate`/`from_json` are isolated). The two tables are both correct;
they measure different things:

- Table A calls `concerto-core`'s Rust API directly, in one process, no
  serialisation boundary.
- Table B's `rust` rows go through `concerto-core`'s TS views
  (`src/engine/`), which for every `ModelManager`/`ModelFile` operation
  in these workloads currently: serialises the AST/value to a JSON
  string on the TS side (`JSON.stringify`), crosses into WASM, and
  (for `add_model`/`validateAst`) re-parses it there - `load_validate`'s
  per-model `add_model` and `validate_ast` each do this once *per model*,
  so the 35- and 41-model sets pay that cost 35 and 41 times over, and
  the single 300-declaration `synthetic-large` model pays it once for a
  much larger string. This matches the migration plan's own risk list
  (§7: "WASM boundary cost and browser sync-compile limits") and the
  P4-01 spike's brief - it is the expected shape of an unoptimised
  per-call FFI boundary, not a defect in the underlying Rust logic
  (Table A's `validate`/`from_json` numbers show that logic is already
  fast). No fast-path batching (e.g. handing the whole model set across
  the boundary once) exists yet for these calls; that is future work, not
  something this benchmarking task changes (see "Scope" below).

³ Both engines reject `synthetic-large` in `validate_ast`, for different
surface reasons that both round-trip to the same TS message: TS's own
`validateAst` schema check rejects the `DateTimeProperty` `defaultValue`
in that model (footnote 3 above); under `CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust`, the
call reaches `rustHandle.validateAst` first and is rejected there before
TS's own check would even run. Either way, `n=0/1` for this cell in both
columns.

## Workload 3: instance validation

New this task on the Rust crate side (task P3-01 landed
`concerto_core::instance::validate::validate_instance` after P5-04a
shipped): `concerto-rust`'s `benches/instance_validate.rs` times
`validate_instance` alone, over the *same* 500-instance workload
`run-ts.mjs` generates (`org.accordproject.bench.instance@1.0.0.Item`,
built directly from its `concerto.metamodel@1.0.0` AST on the Rust side,
since there is no CTO parser there - see that bench file's docs).

There is still no `JSONPopulator`/`Resource` port on the Rust side (task
P3-01b), so only `validate_instance` - the counterpart to TS's
`resource.validate()` alone, **not** to `Serializer#fromJSON`'s combined
populate-and-validate figure - is comparable to the Rust crate:

| Metric | n | TS (µs/op) | TS CV | Rust crate (µs/op) | Rust CV | Rust /TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Serializer#fromJSON` (populate + validate) | 500 | 8.8 | 25.2% | - (no populator yet) | - | - |
| `Resource#validate()` / `validate_instance` | 500 | 2.1 | 13.2% | 4.4 | 9.2% | 2.1× (slower) |

The Rust engine (WASM)-via-TS figures for both metrics are in Table B
above (14.9× and 30.8× slower than TS respectively) - the same
boundary-cost story as the rest of that table.

## Reproducibility

Each harness was run twice on this machine, back to back:

- **TS** (`run-ts.mjs`, both engines): every workload's median reproduced
  within about 1-20% between the two runs (worst case:
  `concerto-core-test-data`/`load` under `CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust`, 1548.5 µs
  then 1292.9 µs, ~20%; most workloads were within 10%, consistent with
  P5-04a's "10-15%" finding).
- **Rust crate** (`cargo bench --manifest-path benches/Cargo.toml`): a
  full run (committed above) followed by a `--quick` rerun agreed within
  each benchmark's own confidence interval - criterion's own built-in
  comparison reported "No change in performance detected" (p > 0.05) on
  every one of the nine `load_validate`/`validate_metamodel` benchmarks.

Per-sample CV is noisier for the smallest, sub-100µs-per-op workloads in
this shared, sandboxed environment (GC pauses, scheduler jitter) - see
`migration/bench/README.md`'s "Variance" section - but medians hold up
across reruns, which is what the exit condition asks for.

## Scope

Per the coordinator's note on the issue: this task added only new
benchmark files (`concerto-rust`'s `benches/benches/instance_validate.rs`
and this repo's `run-ts.mjs`/`RESULTS.md` extensions) plus building the
already-existing `concerto-wasm` crate unchanged (`sh build.sh`) so
`CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust` could be exercised - no engine, view, or test
changes. `run-ts.mjs`'s existing `validateAst` stub gained a `getName()`
method (the rust-delegating branch of `BaseModelManager#validateAst`
calls it; the TS branch never needed it) so `validate_ast` could run
under both engines - the only change to a P5-04a file.

## Refreshing this table

```sh
# TS reference
cd concerto
CONCERTO_ENGINE=ts node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs --out migration/bench/results/ts-reference.json

# Rust engine via the TS public API - needs `@accordproject/concerto-engine`
# built first: cd ../concerto-rust/concerto-wasm && sh build.sh
# (see packages/concerto-engine/README.md)
CONCERTO_ENGINE=rust node migration/bench/run-ts.mjs --out migration/bench/results/ts-rust-engine.json

# Rust crate directly (add --features validate-rs for the
# concerto-validate-rs half of workload 2)
cd ../concerto-rust
cargo bench --manifest-path benches/Cargo.toml && ./benches/extract-results.sh
```

Re-run after later phases land, as the plan asks (§4, task P5-04), and
update the tables above from the new `results/*.json` files.

## Appendix: the P5-04a baseline (2026-09-24)

Kept verbatim for history; Table A above supersedes its numbers on the
current heads (the `validate` skips it records have since closed).

Committed baseline for accordproject/concerto-rust#92 (task P5-04a).
Recorded from one run of each harness, on the same machine, in the same
session: `run-ts.mjs` with its defaults (5 warm-up + 30 timed samples per
workload) and a full criterion run (criterion's defaults: 3 s warm-up,
100 samples per benchmark - *not* `--quick`).
