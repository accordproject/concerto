A lightweight schema language and runtime for business concepts.

```cs
concept Person identified by name  {
  o String name
  o Address address optional
  @description("Height (cm)")
  o Double height range=[0,]
  o DateTime dateOfBirth 
}
```

üè¢ Concerto gives you ‚Äújust enough‚Äù expressivity to capture real-world business models, while remaining easy to map to most runtime environments.

‚õ≥ An object-oriented language that is much easier to read and write than JSON/XML Schema, XMI or equivalents.

üìÑ Serialize your instances to JSON

üç™ Deserialize (and validate) instances from JSON

üîé Introspect the model using a [powerful set of APIs](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-api.html)

üéõ Convert the model to other formats:
- JSON Schema
- XML Schema
- OData CDSL
- GraphQL Schema
- Java Classes
- Go Types
- C# Classes
- TypeScript Classes
- Protobuf Messages
- PlantUML Diagrams
- Mermaid UML Diagrams
- Markdown (with embedded Mermaid)
- OpenAPI v3 specification document
- Apache Avro

üï∏ Publish your reusable models to any website, including the Accord Project [model repository](https://models.accordproject.org)

Infer models from other formats:
- JSON document
- JSON Schema
- OpenAPI v3 specification document

## Getting Started

- Install the [Command Line Tool](https://concerto.accordproject.org/docs/tools/ref-concerto-cli)
- Read the [Concerto specification](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-concerto.html)

```console
$ npm i -g @accordproject/concerto-cli
$ concerto compare --old model.cto --new model-with-changes.cto 
[required-field-added]: The required field "weight" was added to the concept "Person" (major) 
```

- Open VSCode ([on the web](https://github.dev/accordproject/models/blob/master/src/address%400.2.0.cto), [on your machine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=accordproject.cicero-vscode-extension))

![VSCode Editor](https://accordproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/af57b31d0eb66154bce4e0ffec780027.png)

- Add to your [Node.js project](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-api.html)
- Add to your [.NET project](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccordProject.Concerto)

## Structure of the Code

Top level repository (concerto), with sub packages. Each sub-package is published as an independent npm module using npm workspaces:
* [concerto-core](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-core) : core library for model management/parsing/validation/serialization
* [concerto-util](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-util) : contains utility functions used in other parts of the code and fundamentally independent from Concerto as a modeling language
* [concerto-cto](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-cto) : contains the parser for the .cto syntax for Concerto. The parser now outputs a proper Concerto object, instance of the metamodel rather than a custom JSON object.
* [concerto-vocabulary](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-vocabulary) : functionality to handle model vocabularies and localization
* [concerto-analysis](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-analysis) : tools for comparing model files
* [concerto-types](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto/tree/master/packages/concerto-types) : TypeScript type definitions for Concerto
* [concerto-dotnet](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto-dotnet) : .NET type definitions for Concerto, and serialization tools
